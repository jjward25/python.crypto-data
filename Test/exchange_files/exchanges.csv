Exchanges is the daily trade volume of the top 100 exchanges by trust score

Exchange volume returns the daily volume for a given exchange for a given number of days

Exchange ID is the full list of exchanges (names & ids)


"Can use the exchange volume to get historicals for exchanges.  Probably only need the top 10 or so, then maybe sum the rest"
After gathering historicals can just pull from exchanges every day
